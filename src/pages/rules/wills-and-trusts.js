                Attorneys owe their clients a duty of confidentiality. A
                fundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship is taht
                the lawyer must not reveal any information relating to
                representation without the client's consent. This contributes to
                the trust that is the hallmark of the relationship. The duty of
                confidentiality applies to all information relating to the
                representation no matter where it came from and continues to
                apply even after the representation has ended.
                <br />
                However, a lawyer may (but is not required to) reveal
                information relating to the representation of a client to the
                extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary: <br />
                (1) to prevent reasonably certain death or bodily harm <br />
                (2) to prevent the client from committing a future crime or
                fraud that is reasonably certain to cause substantial financial
                loss to another if the lawyer's services were used to perpetrate
                fraud. <br />
                (3) to establish a claim or defense in a controversy between the
                lawyer and client <br />
                (4) to comply with anothe ethical rule, other law, or a court
                order (false evidence) <br />
                Where practicable, before revealing confidential information,
                the lawyer should first seek to persuade the client not to
                commit the act and inform the client of the lawyer's ability to
                reveal such information. In revealing confidential information,
                disclosure should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably
                believes is necessary to accomplish the purpose. Disclosure is
                ordinarily a last resort.
